**Â© 2022 Mars Buttfield-Addison**

A simple C library for parsing stream- or file-based radio telescope data in **VDIF**[^1] or **CODIF**[^2] formats.

## Usage

VDIFparse can be given data to parse in either of two ways: **from streamed or piped input** or **from a file**. These loosely correlate with the two ways a user is likely to interact with VDIF data: **live** (as data comes in from a telescope or similar source) or **later** (on historical data at rest).

**Usage with Live Data:** `StreamMode`

```c
in = open_stream();

close(in);
```

**Usage with Historical Data:** `FileMode`

```c
in = open_file("input_file.vdif");

close(in);
```
